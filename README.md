Data tells a story, and I explored one through **Pizza Sales!** 🍕  

I used **SQL to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a pizza sales dataset to uncover trends and insights that could help optimize sales strategies.  

Here’s what I found:  
✔ **Total Orders:** 8,023  
✔ **Total Revenue:** $39,113.25  
✔ **Most Ordered Pizza:** Greek Pizza  
✔ **Most Popular Size:** Large  
✔ **Top 5 Bestselling Pizzas:**  
1️⃣ The Pepperoni Pizza – 142 Orders  
2️⃣ The Barbecue Chicken Pizza – 118 Orders  
3️⃣ The Thai Chicken Pizza – 113 Orders  
4️⃣ The California Chicken Pizza – 108 Orders  
5️⃣ The Classic Deluxe Pizza – 107 Orders  

This project helped me sharpen my **SQL & data analytics skills**, and I’m excited to share it! Would love to hear your thoughts on it.
